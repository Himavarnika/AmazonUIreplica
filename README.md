# Amazon Clone 

This is a basic **Amazon homepage clone** built using only **HTML and CSS**. The goal of this project was to replicate the visual layout of Amazonâ€™s front page as closely as possible.

I took this up as a personal learning project to strengthen my frontend skills, especially in layout design,  and using Flexbox for alignment.

>  This is an educational project and is **not affiliated** with Amazon in any way.

# Tools & Resources Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and content
- **CSS3**: Styling, layout, hover effects
- **Font Awesome** (via CDN):  
  Icons like the search magnifier, cart icon, location pin, and hamburger menu were sourced from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).  
  I included the CDN like this:

  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.7.1/css/all.min.css">
